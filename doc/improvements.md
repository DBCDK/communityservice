# Improvements

## Divide Actions

Because Actions can point to Entities and/or Profiles, the community has to keep Actions strictly separated by their type based on whether the Action points to a Profile, an Entity, or both.

Possible improvement (v2): Split Actions into three separate tables.

## More RESTful

Possible improvement (v2): Never use id numbers directly, always use the URL.
